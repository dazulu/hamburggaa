The official website for Hamburg GAA (Gaelic Athletic Association) Club - showcasing club information, events, and community content for Gaelic sports enthusiasts in Hamburg, Germany.

## Architecture

This is a statically-generated website built with **Next.js App Router** and powered by **Contentful CMS**. The architecture enables non-technical users to manage all content while maintaining excellent performance and SEO.

**Key Features:**
- üåê **Fully internationalized** (English/German) with localized URLs
- ‚ôø **Accessibility-focused** - follows WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines
- ‚ö° **Static generation** for optimal performance
- üé® **Modular content system** - all page content managed via Contentful
- üîí **Type-safe** with auto-generated TypeScript types from GraphQL schema
- üöÄ **Deployed on Netlify** with continuous deployment

## Tech Stack

**Frontend:**
- Next.js 15 (App Router)
- React 19
- TypeScript
- CSS Modules

**Content & Data:**
- Contentful (Headless CMS)
- GraphQL with auto-generated types
- next-intl for internationalization

**Development:**
- Biome (linting/formatting)
- GraphQL Code Generator
- Turbopack (fast builds)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 21+ and Yarn (see `.nvmrc` for exact version)
- Contentful account with space ID and access token

### Environment Setup

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:

```env
CONTENTFUL_SPACE_ID=your_space_id
CONTENTFUL_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_access_token
```

### Installation & Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
yarn install

# Generate types from Contentful schema
yarn generate-types

# Start development server
yarn dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` to see the site.

### Building for Production

```bash
# Build static site
yarn build

# Preview production build
yarn start
```

## How It Works

The application follows a **content-first architecture**:

1. **Content Management**: All page content, navigation, and site configuration is managed in Contentful
2. **Type Generation**: TypeScript types are auto-generated from the Contentful GraphQL schema
3. **Page Rendering**: Next.js fetches content at build time and generates static pages
4. **Modular Components**: Each content type (Hero, Text, Images, etc.) has its own React component
5. **Internationalization**: Content is fetched based on locale, with fully localized URLs

## Development

### Content Management

All content is managed through [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/). The site uses a modular approach where pages are composed of reusable content modules.

### Type Safety

TypeScript types are automatically generated from the Contentful GraphQL schema:

```bash
yarn generate-types
```

This ensures type safety across the entire application and catches content structure changes at build time.

### Creating New Modules

To quickly scaffold a new content module:

```bash
node create-module.js ModuleName
```

This creates a new folder in `/ui/modules/` with skeleton files.

### Available Scripts

```bash
yarn dev          # Development server with Turbopack
yarn build        # Production build
yarn type-check   # TypeScript validation
yarn biome        # Lint and format code
yarn test-all     # Run all checks
```
